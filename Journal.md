I'm really struggling with this assignment. There are so many pieces moving at the same time and troubleshooting a bugs takes hours and hours.
I'm trying hard, but couldn't put together what I wanted. I spent most of my time getting express and node working and then things crashed again, so some of my functions might not even be complete.
For now this is what I could possibly put together. I will try harder for next assignment and practice more.
